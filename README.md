## Routes

We need to define a type for our rows

type Routes = Variant
  ( "int" :: Int
  , "string" :: String
  )

and a parser / serializer for our rows

route âˆ· D.RouteDuplex' Routes
route = D.root $ RouteDuplex.Variant.variant' routes
  where
    routes =
      { "int": D.int D.segment
      , "string": D.string D.segment
      }
